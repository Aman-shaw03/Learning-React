There are 2 terms that are used Interchangeabily
1. HTTP 
2. HTTPS

just the difference between them that In HTTP => Data are send in normal text or int format , which can be easily read
but in HTTPS => there is a additional layer(protocol) that perform some operations and encrypt the data with a key , which cant be read easily , we need to decrypt it to read it

HTTP => basic use of transfering text in best optimized way between client and server (this to and fro is called a protocol) 

some terms in HTTP :-   URL = Uniform Resource locater
                        URI = Uniform Resource Identifier
                        URN = Uniform Resource Name

what are HTTP Headers?

Headers are the META-DATA => its in Key-value pair which is sent along with Request and Response 
earler we use X-Prefix for metadata (deprecated now) 

we use Headers for many purpose like Caching , authentication and state management
