Currently we are Gonna using Redux Toolkit with Redux

some History before this :

Before Redux toolkit => Redux  => Flux which is controlling the state management but there was so many issues

so in 2015 Redux was introduced with state management and some abstraction for debugging but the setup time is much more compared to our ContextAPI and so many bugs 
so later they introduced Redux Toolkit and it has less setup time with dev tools for debugging , it take use of some function of Redux like useSelelctor , useDispatch so we need to both Redux and redux toolkit on our system

Redux is for JS React-redux is specifically for React (connecting with react framework )

REDUX - A predictable state container for JavaScript applications


REDUX-TOOLKIT - The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development
REACT-REDUX - Official React bindings for Redux
